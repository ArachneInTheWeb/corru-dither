# Welcome to corru.dither
- - -
Are you a fan of corru.observer? Fancy adding a cool CGA-styled dither effect to your art and or animation? Does the idea of trying to use ImageMagick via the command line make you want to run away screaming in fear? Then this program is for you!

# Warning
- - -
This program is still in early alpha and is therefore _extremely_ scuffed. It is probably riddled with bugs and may engage in unexpected behaviour, or crash if looked at too hard. </br>

Here is a list of things corru.dither does not yet support:
- Transparency
- Custom color palettes
- A better colorspace than RGB
- At least one inexplicably nonfunctional gif file!
- A pretty UI

Here is a list of things it does support:
- Animated gifs!
- An (admittedly very scuffed) contrast and brightness slider for tweaking the quantization levels of your image
- Evil mode!
- Running on multiple platforms! Hopefully!

All of these things and more will be featured in future engoodening updates as development progresses. If you're still interested and have sufficiently lowered your expectations, [feel free to check out the initial release here.](https://github.com/ArachneInTheWeb/corru-dither/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta-snapshot-prerelease)
